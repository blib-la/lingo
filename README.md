## Syntax

Lingo, a flexible pseudo language, allows anyone to easily adapt and modify it at any time, encouraging creativity and meeting various needs for a wide audience.

### Values

-   `{{key}}`: This is a placeholder for a variable or input value that will be replaced with actual content when used.

-   `~{{key}}`: The tilde (~) symbol is used to indicate an approximate value or range for the specified key. In this context, it means that the generated content should have a length close to the value of `key`.
    
-   `+{{key}}`: The plus (+) symbol is used to append or concatenate the value of `key` with another element. In this context, it means adding the specified property or attribute to the generated content.
    
-   `={{key}}`: The equals (=) symbol is used to indicate that the generated content should have an exact match or value equal to `key`.
    
-   `!{{key}}`: The exclamation (!) symbol is used to negate or exclude the value of `key` from the generated content. In this context, it means that the specified property or attribute should not be present in the output.
    
-   `-{{key}}`: The minus (-) symbol is used to remove or subtract the value of `key` from the generated content. In this context, it means excluding the specified property or attribute from the output.

-   `*{{key}}`: The asterisk (\*) symbol can be used to indicate that the generated content should repeat the specified property or attribute `key` times.
    
-   `>{{key}}`: The greater than (>) symbol can be used to indicate that the generated content should have a length greater than the value of `key`.
    
-   `<{{key}}`: The less than (<) symbol can be used to indicate that the generated content should have a length less than the value of `key`.

-   `<={{key}}`: The less than or equal to (<=) symbol is used to indicate that the generated content should have a length less than or equal to the value of `key`.
    
-   `>={{key}}`: The greater than or equal to (>=) symbol is used to indicate that the generated content should have a length greater than or equal to the value of `key`. 

-   `?{{key1}}:{{key2}}`: This syntax can be used for conditional expressions, where if the condition specified by `key1` is met, the generated content will include `key2`.

### Keywords
    
-   `ANY`: This keyword can be used to indicate that any of the specified conditions or constraints can be met in the generated content, not necessarily all of them.

-   `ALWAYS`: This keyword can be used to indicate that a specific condition or constraint should always be met in the generated content.

-   `NEVER`: This keyword indicates that a specific condition or constraint should never be met in the generated content.
    
-   `WITH`: This keyword is used to specify that the generated content should include certain properties or attributes.
    
-   `AND`: This keyword is used to combine multiple conditions or constraints in the generated content.
    
-   `ONLY`: This keyword is used to indicate that the generated content should exclusively meet certain conditions or constraints.
    
-   `NOT`: This keyword is used to negate a condition or constraint, meaning that the specified property or attribute should not be present in the output.
    
-   `UNIQUE`: This keyword is used to indicate that the generated content should be original and not duplicate any existing content.

### Functions

-   `between({{key1}}, {{key2}})`: This syntax can be used to specify a range for a certain attribute or property, indicating that the generated content should have a value between `key1` and `key2`.

-   `random({{key1}}, {{key2}}, ...)`: This syntax can be used to specify that the generated content should include one of the provided keys at random.

-   `mixed({{key1}}, {{key2}}, ...)`: This syntax can be used to specify that the generated content should include a combination of the provided keys.

-   `contains({{key}})`: This syntax can be used to indicate that the generated content must contain the specified key.

-   `optimize({{key}})`: This syntax can be used to suggest that the generated content should optimize for a certain aspect, such as readability or keyword density, represented by the key.

-   `limit({{key}}, {{value}})`: This syntax can be used to set a limit on the number of times the specified key can appear in the generated content.

    
### Function Arguments

-   `fn(-{{key}})`: This syntax represents a function `fn` that takes the value of `key` as an input and removes or subtracts it from the generated content.
    
-   `fn(*{{key}})`: This syntax represents a function `fn` that takes the value of `key` as an input and repeats a specific property or attribute `key` times.
    
-   `fn(?{{key1}}:{{key2}})`: This syntax represents a function `fn` that takes the values of `key1` and `key2` as inputs and includes `key2` in the generated content if the condition specified by `key1` is met.
            
-   `fn(+{{key}})`: This syntax represents a function `fn` that takes the value of `key` as an input and appends or concatenates it with another element.
    
-   `fn(~{{key}})`: This syntax represents a function `fn` that takes the value of `key` as an input and generates content with a length close to the value of `key`.
        
-   `fn(between({{key1}}, {{key2}}))`: This syntax represents a function `fn` that takes the values of `key1` and `key2` as inputs and generates content with a value between `key1` and `key2`

-   `fn(random({{key1}}, {{key2}}, ...))`: This syntax represents a function `fn` that takes multiple keys as inputs and generates content with one of the provided keys at random.
        
-   `fn(optimize({{key}}))`: This syntax represents a function `fn` that takes the value of `key` as an input and generates content optimized for the specified aspect.
